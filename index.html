    <p> Hello! My name is Christine Guarnieri. I am currently a third year student at Northeastern University studying
        Data Science and Business Administration with a concentration in Finance. I am particularly interested in using
        data science and machine learning to gain insight into financial markets. Outside of my major, I am interested
        in the legal field. I am a part of Northeasternâ€™s Mock Trial team (see below for a team photo), and I have competed in Mock Trial since I was
        in high school. Apart from my involvement at Northeastern, I enjoy going to concerts in the greater Boston area
        as well as reading a good book. </p>

    <p>On the topic of books, the last few books I read are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Goldfinch by Donna Tart</li>
          <li>Malibu Rising by Taylor Jenkins Reid</li>
          <li>Normal People by Sally Rooney</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> just to name a few.</p>
